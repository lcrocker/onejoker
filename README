OneJoker is a general-purpose card game and simulation library for
Python created by Lee Daniel Crocker in 2013. To the extent possible
under law, I waive all copyright and related or neighboring rights to
this work. Where I have included the work of others, this is noted
and such work may be licensed under different terms.

It is written in C and Python using cmake <www.cmake.org>. Though it
could certainly be used directly in C or C++ programs, it is designed
with the goal of higher-level language bindings in mind. For example,
the C code never allocates memory, but relies on the client (in this
case the Python language binding is the client) for that. I try to
write portably, but I'm sure there are some Linuxisms here that
porters will have to smooth over.

To build on Linux, either create a build directory parallel to "src",
change to it, and type

  cmake -g 'Unix Makefiles' ../src

or else type

  cmake -g 'Unix Makefiles' src

from the top-level directory itself. The former is cleaner, the latter
seems to work better for Eclipse. You should then be able to "make"
from the build directory.

========
Overview
========

The two design choices to understand are card numbers and sequences. A
card is represented by an integer from 1 to 54. "0" is usually used for
error returns and such. 1 is the deuce of clubs, followed by the deuce
of diamonds, hearts, and spades; 5 is the trey of clubs, 6 the trey of
diamonds, etc., up to 52, the Ace of spades. 53 is the joker, and 54 is
the "colored" joker for games that distinguish between the two.

When cards are represented as text for input and output, each is two
characters, for rank and suit, e.g., "2c", "5d", "Qh", "As". Tens use
the letter T, so the 10 of diamonds is "Td". The joker is "JK" and the
colored joker is "J2".

The second important structure in this library is called a "sequence"
which is simply an ordered list of cards. This may represent a whole
deck or stub (or even a multi-deck shoe), a single hand, a community
board, or anything else needed for a particular game.
