OneJoker is a general-purpose card game and simulation library for
Python created by Lee Daniel Crocker in 2013. To the extent possible
under law, I waive all copyright and related or neighboring rights to
this work. Where I have included the work of others, this is noted
and such work may be licensed under different terms.

OneJoker consists of a shared library written in pure C, and a Python
module that calls into the shared library. It is designed primarily
to be used with its Python binding, but the C code can be used as a
C library in its own right if you need the greatest possible speed, at
the expense of some clarity. This should rarely be necessary, though,
since the Python binding is quite adequate for doing billions of hands
in reasonable time.

It is written for Linux. I know nothing about Windows or OS/X how easy
it might be to port to those. I stick to pretty vanilla C, so it
shouldn't be difficult. I also assume Python 3. Back-porting shouldn't
be too tricky if necessary.

I use cmake <http://www.cmake.org> to build the library. This should
make porting easier. The way I build it on Linux is to change into the
top-level directory of the git repository, then type

  cmake -g 'Unix Makefiles' src

to build the Makefiles, then "make" to build everything.

Overview
========

The two design choices to understand are card numbers and sequences. A
card is represented by an integer from 1 to 54. "0" is usually used for
error returns and such. 1 is the deuce of clubs, followed by the deuce
of diamonds, hearts, and spades; 5 is the trey of clubs, 6 the trey of
diamonds, etc., up to 52, the Ace of spades. 53 is the joker, and 54 is
the "colored" joker for games that distinguish between the two.

When cards are represented as text for input and output, each is two
characters, for rank and suit, e.g., "2c", "5d", "Qh", "As". Tens use
the letter T, so the 10 of diamonds is "Td". The joker is "JK" and the
colored joker is "J2". On input, the library is a bit more flexible,
ignoring case and whitespace and allowing "10".

The second important structure in this library is called a "sequence"
which is simply an ordered list of cards. This may represent a whole
deck or stub (or even a multi-deck shoe), a single hand, a community
board, or anything else needed for a particular game.
