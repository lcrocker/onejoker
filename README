OneJoker is a general-purpose card game and simulation library
created by Lee Daniel Crocker in 2013. To the extent possible under
law, I waive all copyright and related or neighboring rights to
this work. Where I have included the work of others, this is noted
and such work may be licensed under different terms.

It is written in C using cmake <www.cmake.org>. Though it could
certainly be used directly in C or C++ programs, it is designed with
the goal of higher-level language bindings in mind. For example, it
never allocates memory, but relies on the client for that. I try
to write portably, but I'm sure there are some Linuxisms here that
porters will have to smooth over.
