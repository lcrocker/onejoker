h1. Building the library from source

h2. Linux

You will need to have all the common Linux development tools installed, including @gcc@ and @gmake@. In addition, you will have to have Python 3 to use the Python binding. If you have an earlier version of Python installed, you can install Python 3 as well and the two get along fairly well together. You will need a Java JDK--I recommend ["openjdk":http://openjdk.java.net/]. Finally, make sure you have the @realpath@ tool installed or you'll have to change the first line of the Makefile.

Download and unpack the source from this ["zipfile":http://github.com/lcrocker/ojcardlib/archive/master.zip] or use git:

{% highlight bash %}
git clone http://github.com/lcrocker/ojcardlib
{% endhighlight %}

From the root of the tree you just installed, @make@ should now build everything including the basic tests, putting everything into the @build@ directory and running the tests.

h2. Windows

You'll need to install ["MinGW":http://www.mingw.org], ["Python 3":http://www.python.org/download], and a Java JDK. Make sure the Java compiler and tools and the python interpreter are in your PATH.

Download and unpack the source from this ["zipfile":http://github.com/lcrocker/ojcardlib/archive/master.zip] or use git:

{% highlight bash %}
git clone http://github.com/lcrocker/ojcardlib
{% endhighlight %}

Then from the root of the tree you just installed, build the library and basic tests with:

{% highlight bash %}
make -f Makefile.mingw
{% endhighlight %}

This should now build everything including the basic tests, putting everything into the @build@ directory and running the tests.
