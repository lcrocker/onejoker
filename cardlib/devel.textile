h1. Library development

My primary development environment is Linux. Specifically Ubuntu, but any other reasonably modern distribution should be fine. You'll need the basic @gcc@ toolchain to build the library, and Python 3 (the build script is in Python). You'll need a Java SDK of some kind to build the Java bindings--I use @openjdk@.

On Windows, I use MinGW. This or Cygwin should work. Again, Python 3, and a Java SDK.

Porting to a new OS should mostly involve:

Figuring out how to build a shared library, figure out the best way to seed the PRNG.
