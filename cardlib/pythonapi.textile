h1. Using the library in your Python code


As long as your Python implementation can find the library where you have installed it, programs need only import the package @ojcardlib@. Further details of the functions available are shown in the ["Python API":/onejoker/cardlib/pythonapi.html] document. A short example:

{% highlight python %}
import ojcardlib as oj

deck = oj.CardList(52)
deck.fill()
deck.shuffle()

hand = oj.CardList(5)
for i in range(5):
    hand.append(deck.pop())

print(hand)
{% endhighlight %}
