h1. Installing the library

h2. Windows

Download "this zipfile":/OneJoker/binaries/onejoker-win32-0.0.1.zip and unpack it. This will give you the file @onejoker.dll@. To use this in your code without installing it system-wide, just put it in the same directory with your @.exe@. To install it system-wide, copy it to the @system32@ directory.

h2. Linux x86

h3. Option 1: Install to @/usr/local/lib@

Download "this zipfile":/OneJoker/binaries/onejoker-linux-x86-0.0.1.zip and unpack it. This will give you a file @libonejoker.so.0.0.1@. If directory @/usr/local/lib@ does not exist, create it. Copy the library there, and make two symbolic links to it (you'll probably need @sudo@ for this and some of the following commands). Finally, tell the OS to re-cache libraries using @ldconfig@:

{% highlight bash %}
cp libonejoker.so.0.0.1 /usr/local/lib
cd /usr/local/lib
ln -s libonejoker.so.0.0.1 libonejoker.so.0
ln -s libonejoker.so.0.0.1 libonejoker.so
ldconfig
{% endhighlight %}

That should do it. On some distributions, the OS may not always look in the @/usr/local/lib@ directory. In that case, you will also have to edit the file @/etc/ld.so.conf@ to add it. Just add @/usr/local/lib@ on a line by itself at the end of the file, then run @ldconfig@ again.

h3. Option 2: Install in personal directory

If you can't (or don't want to) install the library system-wide, you can keep it somewhere in your home directory and tell the OS to look for it there. This is handy, for example, if you want to make changes to the library. Download the "zipfile":/OneJoker/binaries/onejoker-linux-x86-0.0.1.zip as above and unpack it. This will give you a file @libonejoker.so.0.0.1@.

For the purposes of this example, assume that you want to have the library in the directory @/home/lib@, and you have copied it there. Go there and make the two symbolic links:

{% highlight bash %}
cp libonejoker.so.0.0.1
cd /home/lib
ln -s libonejoker.so.0.0.1 libonejoker.so.1
ln -s libonejoker.so.0.0.1 libonejoker.so
{% endhighlight %}

Now either add the @/home/lib@ directory to @LD_LIBRARY_PATH@, or add it to @/etc/ld.conf@, and re-cache libraries with @ldconfig@.
