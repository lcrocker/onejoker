h1. Using the library in your code

h2. Python

In Python, just import the module (giving it a short name is also handy):

{% highlight python %}
import onejoker as oj
print (oj.name(oj.rand(52) + 1))
{% endhighlight %}

This should print the short name of a random card (e.g. "2c", "Ah", etc.) See some "examples":http://lcrocker.github.io/OneJoker/docs/examples-python.html of complete Python programs using the library.

h2. Java

In Java code, import the classes and load the library at the top of your main class:

{% highlight java %}
import com.onejoker.onejoker.*;

public class Basic {
    static {
        System.loadLibrary("onejoker");
    }
    public static void main(String args[]) {
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

See some "examples":http://lcrocker.github.io/OneJoker/docs/examples-java.html of complete Java programs using the library.

h2. C

When compiling your C code against the library, add @-lonejoker@ to the link command. If you've installed the library someplace like @/home/lib@, you may also have to add @-L/home/lib@ to tell the linker where to find it. In your C code, just include the single header:

{% highlight cpp %}
#include "onejoker.h"
{% endhighlight %}

See some "examples":http://lcrocker.github.io/OneJoker/docs/examples-c.html of complete C programs using the library.
