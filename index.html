      <h1>The OneJoker Project</h1>
<p><strong>OneJoker</strong> is a collection of code and other resources for writing card games and simulations. Currently this includes:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="/randlib/index.html">RandLib</a>: A library of state-of-the-art algorithms for generating and using pseudo-random numbers. Can be used by people just needing a good <span class="caps">PRNG</span> or by people developing PRNGs to provide all the necessary accompanying code and tests without extra work.</li>
	<li><a href="/cardlib/index.html">CardLib</a>: A library of routines specific to card games and simulations. Includes things like shuffling decks, dealing hands, evaluating hands, and some high-powered combinatorics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both <strong>RandLib</strong> and <strong>CardLib</strong> are written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>, with binding code to allow them to be used from <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/57643/focus=57918">C++</a>, <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>, and <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">Java</a>. C is my &#8220;native tongue&#8221;, and best suited to code that needs to be balls-to-the-wall fast like code to simulate billions of hands of blackjack or poker. Python is my current mistress, and the first tool I reach for to get something done quickly. So being able to call the fast C routines from nice easy-to-write and easy-to-read Python gives me the best of both. Java I&#8217;m pretty indifferent about, but it&#8217;s popular (especially now with the ascent of <a href="http://developer.android.com/index.html">Android</a>), I&#8217;ve used it enough to be familiar with it, so I added that binding. I&#8217;d rather have my teeth pulled without anesthesia than write in C++, but having written the C code, writing a C++ wrapper is only a few lines of code, so those masochists out there who use C++ (or who are forced to use it) can use the libraries too.</p>
<p>I also do all the coding on <a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a>. Software development on <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9005873/Windows_development_chief_I_would_buy_a_Mac_if_I_didn_t_work_for_Microsoft_">Windows</a> isn&#8217;t quite as painful as C++, but it&#8217;s close. I even worked for the Evil Empire briefly back when they were an Empire&#8212;now they&#8217;re kind of the Evil Also-ran. But you can use the libraries from Windows as well, because of a wonderful project called <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a>, which allows us Unix geeks to write software in a familiar environment that runs on Windows. I know nothing at all about Macs or Objective-C. If you want to port my libraries to Cheesy Cheetah or whatever the lastest Apple OS is, you have my blessing, just not my my help. I hear it&#8217;s vaguely Unix-y&#8212;even some of my Linux brethren do their work on Macs&#8212;so it might not be that hard, but I just don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>I plan to also upload things like card images, an Internet game server, explanatory texts (maybe with an opinion or two), full sample programs, and other related things.</p>
