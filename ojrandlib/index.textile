h1. OneJoker random number generator library

This library serves two purposes: first, it's a ready-to-use state-of-the-art random number generation library with multiple algorithms that can be used from C, C++, Java, and Python on Linux or Windows for simulations and other work demanding a fast and good quality PRNG. Second, it can be used by people developing PRNGs to provide all the "filler" code needed around a new algorithm: things like seed management, floating point conversions, and such.
